# Sales-Analysis-and-Marketing-Insights

This project focuses on analyzing a company's fourth-quarter sales data across Australia to support data-driven decision-making for business expansion. The study involves data wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualization to identify high- and low-performing states, examine demographic sales patterns, and evaluate peak/off-peak sales trends. Using tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, the analysis provides clear dashboards and reports for the Sales & Marketing team to design effective revenue-boosting strategies. Additionally, exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing are applied to a marketing mix dataset to understand the impact of customer demographics, spending behavior, and promotional campaigns on sales performance
